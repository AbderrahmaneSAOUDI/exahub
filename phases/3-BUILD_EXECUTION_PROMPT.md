# 3-BUILD EXECUTION PROMPT

You've completed the strategic `plan.md`.
Now it's time to translate it into action: a full roadmap of incremental sprints to ship a polished, working application — fast, clean, and tested.

---

## 📁 INPUT

Scan all files inside `/project-docs/`, including:

- `overview.md`
- `incomplete-features.md`
- `bugs-and-issues.md`
- `ui-ux-gaps.md`
- `dev-roadmap.md`
- `plan.md`
- `database-setup.md` or `data-integrations.md`
- Any other related technical docs

---

## 🎯 OUTPUT

Generate a new file: **`/project-docs/sprints.md`**

This file is a step-by-step execution plan divided into smart, test-driven sprints, each with:

- 🎯 **Sprint Name**
- 🧩 **Goals** — Clear outcomes or what "done" looks like
- 📋 **Tasks** — Broken down by scope (`#api`, `#ui`, `#data`, etc.)
- 🧪 **Testing/Validation Needed**
- ⚠️ **Risk of breaking existing features?**
- ✅ **Linting/console errors to clean up in this scope**

---

## 🔁 GUIDELINES

- No unnecessary complexity. Only what's needed to ship cleanly.
- Prioritize MVP-critical features first.
- Group tasks in logical order (e.g. schema before logic, logic before UI).
- Include testing tasks when functionality or logic needs to be verified before continuing.
- Always check and fix linter errors and visible console warnings during each sprint.
- Don't break existing functionality — if something might, note it + add a test.
- Add `[🧪 TEST]` tags for anything needing manual or automated testing.

## 🔨 SPRINT STRUCTURE EXAMPLE

### 🚀 Sprint 1: Core Auth + User Onboarding

**Goals:**
- Complete full working auth flow with login, register, logout
- Basic onboarding state flow (new user → app ready)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Connect login/signup UI to working Supabase auth (`#auth`)
- [ ] Handle auth errors (wrong creds, weak pass) (`#ui`)
- [ ] Setup onboarding logic and DB flag for `first_time_user` (`#data`, `#logic`)
- [ ] Add fallback loading state + redirection (`#ui`)

**Testing/Validation:**
- `[🧪 TEST]` Signup → login → logout flow
- `[🧪 TEST]` First-time user triggers onboarding
- ✅ Check and fix any auth-related console errors

**Risks:**
- Might affect routing guards
- Be careful not to break session persistence logic

---

## ✅ FINAL GOAL

Produce a sequence of focused, doable sprints — from critical fixes to MVP polish — with enough clarity that any engineer can just start from Sprint 1 and build forward without confusion or regressions.

> **`sprints.md` becomes your day-to-day playbook until launch.**
